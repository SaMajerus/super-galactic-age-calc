# Super Galactic Age Calculator

#### Takes User's birthday, input for the current day, and their demographic group's average life expectancy (in Earth-Years). Then, can convert that into life expectancy and current age of the user on any of these 4 planets in our solar system (based on their respective Solar Year periods compared to Earth): Mercury, Venus, Mars or Jupiter.

## Description




Other Notes, Side-note(s) on Internet sources-- 
* This is the Google Search where I found the initial 'life expectancy' number in Earth-Years in the US:  https://www.google.com/search?q=average+life+expectancy+for+white+male+in+usa&newwindow=1&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS863US863&ei=LW4SY_PCN8e20PEPgpmvoAU&ved=0ahUKEwizjdDN__b5AhVHGzQIHYLMC1QQ4dUDCA4&uact=5&oq=average+life+expectancy+for+white+male+in+usa&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyCggAEEcQ1gQQsAMyCggAEEcQ1gQQsAMyCggAEEcQ1gQQsAMyCggAEEcQ1gQQsAMyCggAEEcQ1gQQsAMyCggAEEcQ1gQQsAMyCggAEEcQ1gQQsAMyCggAEEcQ1gQQsANKBAhBGABKBAhGGABQAFgAYJAGaAFwAXgAgAEAiAEAkgEAmAEAyAEIwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz 

* This is the Search in which I found more-updated life expectancy figures (see 'NYT' and/or 'NPR' results, both published 8-31-2022):   https://www.google.com/search?q=What+is+the+life+expectancy+of+a+white+male+in+the+united+states+in+2022%3F&newwindow=1&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS863US863&ei=eZcTY_KVIcaV0PEPx5aniAQ&ved=0ahUKEwiytsmQm_n5AhXGCjQIHUfLCUEQ4dUDCA4&uact=5&oq=What+is+the+life+expectancy+of+a+white+male+in+the+united+states+in+2022%3F&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6CggAEEcQ1gQQsAM6BAghEApKBAhBGABKBAhGGABQ9AZYlc4BYMbXAWgRcAF4AIAB5AKIAe4ikgEJMTYuMTcuMy4xmAEAoAEByAEHwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz   



## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _This is a great place_
* _to list setup instructions_
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_



## Known Bugs

* Currently there are no Jest tests for the cases in which a user's age in non-Earth-Years is greater than that of the calculated life expectancy on that planet. 
* User input not available currently
