# Super Galactic Age Calculator

#### Takes User's birthday, input for the current day, and their demographic group's average life expectancy (in Earth-Years). Then, can convert that into life expectancy and current age of the user on any of these 4 planets in our solar system (based on their respective Solar Year periods compared to Earth): Mercury, Venus, Mars or Jupiter.
